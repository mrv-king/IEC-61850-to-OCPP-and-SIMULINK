# IEC-61850-to-OCPP-and-SIMULINK
Designed application was developed for transformation of IEC 61850 configuration file of electrical energy system into a Digital Twin model of charging systems for EVs. Generated Digital Twin representation consists of Simulink model of Charging Station and 2 OCPP applications (server and client) to implement the control functions over generated Simulink model.
