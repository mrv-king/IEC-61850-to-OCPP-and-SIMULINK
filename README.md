# IEC-61850-to-OCPP-and-SIMULINK
This application is a virtual commissioning tool for operation in the field of electric vehicle charging (EV). The designed application takes the IEC61850 system configuration file of the electrical system (the file has the ".scd" extension). As the output, the application generates a MATLAB/SIMULINK model of the uploaded electrical system (that file has a ".m" extension) and 2 python scripts (client and server, that both have a ".py extension") used for communication purposes according to OCPP protocol (Open Charge Point Protocol). In a paradigm of OCPP server called "CMS" (Central Management Station) and client is a "CP" (Charging Point). Python code of the "CP" application has an access to MATLAB/SIMULINK model through the "matlab.engine" library. Therefore, it is possible to send commands and receive feedback from "CMS" through the "CP" directly into the MATLAB/SIMULINK model of charging station. By generating a SIMULINK model, it is possible to validate the physical parameters of the charging process, whenever the autogenerated "CMS" and "CP" applications can be used for validation of a communication channel between the charging station and management system.   

Prerequisets:
Two applications should be installed before:
1. MATLAB  version 2015 or later (with the SIMULINK extentions included)
2. Python ver 3.8 (or lower)

List of preinstalled Python libraries:
a. websockets ( pip install websockets ) 
b. ocpp ( pip install ocpp )
c. inputimeout ( pip install inputimeout )

Before start working with designed application, the MATLAB Engine API should be installed for Python. The instruction on how to do it see here:
